"""Ancestry resolution for copy-on-write branching.

Resolves state by walking the branch ancestry graph. Each branch has a parent
(created_from) and a branch_point_exchange. The ancestry chain goes from the
current branch up to "main" (root).

Resolution algorithm for CoW tables (character_state_entries, scene_state_entries):
  for each (branch, max_exchange) in ancestry chain:
      query table WHERE branch=? AND exchange_number <= max_exchange
      ORDER BY exchange_number DESC LIMIT 1
      if found -> return
  return None (or card default)

Trust shortcut (no full ancestry walk needed):
  baseline = trust_baselines[char_a, char_b, branch] or card initial
  mods = SUM(trust_modifications WHERE char_a, char_b, branch)
  return baseline + mods
