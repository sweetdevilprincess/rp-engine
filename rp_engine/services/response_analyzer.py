IMPORTANT: The "NARRATOR" label indicates the AI writing the story - this is NOT a character named "Claude" or "Narrator". The narrator writes for NPCs (like Dante, Elysia, etc.) and describes scenes. Extract the ACTUAL CHARACTER NAMES from the narrative content, not the label "NARRATOR" or "Claude".

Analyze the following {len(exchanges)} exchanges and identify:

1. PLOT THREADS: Which plot threads were mentioned, developed, or resolved?
   - Thread name/ID
   - Status: introduced, developing, progressed, resolved, stalled
   - Key developments

2. MEMORIES: Important scenes or moments worth preserving
   - Description of the moment
   - Why it's significant
   - Characters involved

3. KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARIES: Information shared between characters
   - Who learned what
   - From whom (if applicable)
   - Type: secret revealed, information shared, observation made

4. NEW ENTITIES:
   - Characters: name, role, first appearance
   - Locations: name, description, first mention
   - Objects/Concepts: name, significance

5. RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
   - Characters involved - CRITICAL RULES:
     * Use their ACTUAL CHARACTER NAMES from the story (e.g., "Dante Moretti", "Lilith Graves", "Elysia")
     * NEVER use "Claude", "Narrator", "AI", or "Assistant"
     * NEVER use generic descriptors like "Man", "The Man", "Unknown Man", "Unnamed Man", "Other Character", "The Stranger", "Figure", "Person"
     * If a character is referred to by a nickname (like "Beasty" for Dante), use their REAL name, not the nickname
     * If you can't identify the character's actual name, SKIP that entry entirely
   - Change type - choose carefully:
     * trust_increase: Character genuinely helped, protected, showed vulnerability, or earned respect
     * trust_decrease: Character ACTUALLY BETRAYED, lied maliciously, or broke a promise (rare!)
     * conflict_introduced: Tension, power struggles, threats, arguments (this is NOT trust decrease!)
     * conflict_resolved: Tension de-escalated, understanding reached
     * alliance_formed: Characters agreed to work together
     * alliance_broken: Alliance ended
   - IMPORTANT: Flirtatious banter, power plays, teasing threats, and sexual tension are conflict_introduced, NOT trust_decrease. Trust decrease requires actual betrayal or malicious deception.
   - Evidence from text

6. NPC INTERACTIONS (Important for behavioral tracking):
   - Which NPCs appeared in the scene (use ACTUAL NAMES like "Dante Moretti", not "The Man" or "Beasty")
   - What actions/behaviors they displayed
   - Their apparent emotional state or motivation
   - Any trust-affecting moments (helped, betrayed, protected, threatened, etc.)
   - Whether their behavior seemed consistent with their role

7. STORY STATE (Current state of the world - IMPORTANT):
   - Character locations: Where is each character at the END? (Use ACTUAL NAMES only, never "Man" or "Unknown Character")
   - Character conditions: Any injuries, status effects, emotional states?
   - Scene context: Current location, time of day, atmosphere/mood
   - Significant events: What notable things happened that should be tracked?

8. SCENE SIGNIFICANCE (Flag card-worthy moments):
   - Score 1-10 (1=mundane, 5=notable, 8=major revelation, 10=pivotal)
   - Categories (one or more): secret, backstory, knowledge_shift, emotional_moment, future_plan, relationship_change, plot_development, character_growth
   - Brief: 1-2 sentence description of what's significant
   - Suggested card types: secret, memory, knowledge, lore
   - In-story timestamp if present in the exchanges
